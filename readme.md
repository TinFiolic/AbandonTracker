AbandonTracker is a lightweight addon for World of Warcraft Classic that tracks abandoned quests and displays related quest items in chat. When you abandon a quest, the addon will show you which items were objectives for that quest, which items were provided by the quest giver, and which additional items were required for the quest. This helps you make informed decisions about inventory management after abandoning quests.
